# Task :
  1. Install opencv
      - Create virtual environment
      - pip install opencv-python
  2. Run opencv to access camera.
 
 # Resources Learnt :
 ## opencv: 
 OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. In simple language it is library used for Image Processing. It is mainly used to do all the operation related to Images.
- What it can do - Read and Write Images. - Detection of faces and its features. - Detection of shapes like Circle,rectangle etc in a image. E.g Detection of coin in images.https://youtu.be/kdLM6AOd2vc
 ## pip :
 The pip command is a tool for installing and managing Python packages, such as those found in the Python Package Index.
 ## Virtual environment :
 A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python        virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use.
 
 # Steps For video Processing :

- Install pythonIDE in your system.(it will help to provide path )
- Install pycharm 
NOTE: please make sure that you have already installed pythonIDE before installing pycharm otherwise you will face alot of problem in pip installation as pip comes along with pythonIDE installation.
- Now, open pycharm and create a new project.
- install virtual environment.

- open terminal in it and firstly check the latest version of pip installed in your pycharm by typing the command -> pip --version
IF pip is not of latest version , then type command -> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
IF this command show any kind of error , then try ->      python -m pip install -U --force-reinstall pip
This command would work for you forsure.
- Now make a new file and presss File->settings->project interpretor->'+'(in the right corner)->search for numpy ->install numpy ->search for opencv-python and install it
- Now you are good to go, just write the codes. https://github.com/salonigupta1/Video-processing-using-Open-cv-.git
